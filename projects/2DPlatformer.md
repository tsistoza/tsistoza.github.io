## Why?

I am kind of making games on my own, just because I thought it would be good experience for me, but also because I think it would be quite fun watching an AI play your own game. I do not really plan to release the game, but this is really a project for me to get started with Game Development and Artifical Intelligence. With how Artificial Intelligence has just been blowing up, I think this is a good project to start with.
