## Why?

I am making games on my own, just because I thought it would be good experience for me, but also because I think it would be quite fun watching an AI play your own game. I do not really plan to release the game, but this is really a project for me to get started with Game Development and Artifical Intelligence. With how Artificial Intelligence has just been blowing up, I think this is a good project to start with. Again, this is a project that I wanted to do for fun, but its mainly a 2D platform game, and you have multiple obstacles you have to dodge to get to the end. It is very simple and somewhat easier to train an AI then a 3D game.

## What it takes to make a game?

Now there are several things to consider. One is who is going to do the artstyles and animations. Luckily, Unity Store has an assets store, in which you can either buy assets to use for your game or you can write them yourself. Two is to write the scripts for player to interact with the game. Mostly all the scripts are done in C#. Three is the user experience. Similar to web development, what about the users? Adding a settings mode to adjust the audio or decrease the graphics if needed. Last of all, is you must have a good computer perferably with a GPU. You do no not want to work with computer with 8GB of RAM, things will just go alot smoother if you have a good computer.

## What about AI training?

Now preferably, you want to do AI training in a python script, but Unity only uses C# scripts. Luckily, Unity also comes with ML-Agents frameworks which is specifically used to turn your Unity scenes into a learning environment and train character behaviours using a variety of machine learning algorithms (perferably reinforcement learning).
