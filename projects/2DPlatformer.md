## Why?

I am making games on my own, just because I thought it would be good experience for me, but also because I think it would be quite fun watching an AI play your own game. I do not really plan to release the game, but this is really a project for me to get started with Game Development and Artifical Intelligence. With how Artificial Intelligence has just been blowing up, I think this is a good project to start with. Again, this is a project that I wanted to do for fun, but its mainly a 2D platform game, and you have multiple obstacles you have to dodge to get to the end. It is very simple and somewhat easier to train an AI then a 3D game.
