## What is it?

Basically, having an AI learn to play videos games. I think with AI you have to have some patience, you cant just expect them to play right off the bat. What I find so interesting is just the amount of things you can do with AI, but also the amount of compute power an AI might need is also quite insane, I am still currently trying to train my AI through reinforcement learning, but my current system that I have it working on is quite limited. This is still a WIP progress, it is not easy training an AI to play games.

To be distinct when you hear AI in games, that is not the same AI as the one I am currently implementing. The AI in games have no neural network tied to them, because it would be way to taxing on systems. It is not very common for game developers to use neural networks on there AI for video games, it is just not pratical.
