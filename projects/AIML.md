## What is it?

Basically, having an AI learn to play videos games. I think with AI you have to have some patience, you cant just expect them to play right off the bat. What I find so interesting is just the amount of things you can do with AI, but also the amount of compute power an AI might need is also quite insane, I am still currently trying to train my AI through reinforcement learning, but my current system that I have it working on is quite limited.
