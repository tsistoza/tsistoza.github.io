<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>I am making games on my own, just because I thought it would be pleasant experience for me. I do not really plan to release the game, but this is really a project for me to get started with Game Development and Artificial Intelligence. This is a 2D platform game, and you have multiple obstacles you must dodge to get to the end. Note that these games do require sprites, backgrounds, music, etc… And that is why Unity has the Asset Store. Again, this is just a project that I wanted to do for fun but is also for me to dip my toes into game development.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-take-to-make-a-game">What does it take to make a game?</h2>

<p>Now there are several things to consider. One is who is going to do the styles and animations. Luckily, Unity Store has an assets store, in which you can either buy assets to use for your game or you can write them yourself. Two is to write the scripts for players to interact with the game. Mostly all the scripts are done in C#. Three is the user experience. Like web development, what about the users? Adding a settings mode to adjust the audio or decrease the graphics if needed. Last of all, you must have a good computer, preferably with a GPU. You do not want to work with a computer with 8GB of RAM, things will just go a lot smoother if you have a good computer.</p>

<h2 id="ai-training">AI training?</h2>

<p>I also have an interest in Reinforcement Learning. Note that a games AI is different from a Neural Network AI. Now preferably, you want to do AI training in a python script, but Unity only uses C# scripts. Luckily, Unity also comes with ML-Agent’s frameworks which is specifically used to turn your Unity scenes into a learning environment and train character behaviors using a variety of machine learning algorithms.</p>
