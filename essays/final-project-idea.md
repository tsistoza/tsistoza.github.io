# ICS and ECE Elective Finder

Basically, if you ever find yourself trying to pick out electives, you can come here and try to find what you want to do based on your interests, as well as what is useful relative you what you want to work as. Only doing ICS and ECE classes because there are absolutely a ton of classes in just those two, but maybe we will consider adding more. Here are some features that we might consider based on our work load.

So here is what we are thinking now, first you have to make an account and specify whether you are an Computer Science Student or a Computer Engineering Student, also lists interests (maybe classes you have already taken). Based on all those specifications the app will list out a bunch of classes that you can take, then you can add that to your list, so when it is registration time you have it all ready. Here is some features that we might consider adding:

* Filter out classes based on requirements of the class, and interests of the class.
* Add a professor rating, because students do look into that.
* Random Picker, if you don't know what to choose, choose a random class.
* Past Students experience with that class.
* Considering adding an instructor profiles, if professors what to add some classes to the database.
