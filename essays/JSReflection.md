## My Experience

My experiences with Software Engineering so far have been good. I do have a couple of projects that I want to continue developing, that require a bit of software engineering to finish off. As I am a Computer Engineering Major, expanding my toolbox is what I enjoy to do, for me, it is fun learning new things, improving on what you have known so far and ultimately creating fun projects from what you have learned. Which, includes what I am learning right now which is JavaScript. I have somewhat of an idea of how JavaScript works, because during summer breaks I usually learn new stuff through YouTube. Personally I could not get into JavaScript, because when you compare C/C++/C#, it is severely different, obviously now it is a different story. Work out of the Day or WODs for short, are challenging and an ultimately help me familiarize myself with JavaScript. Now on what I think of Athletic Software Engineering, I think itâ€™s good for teaching students and familiarizing students with concepts that they have just learned. 

## Whats interests me?

My interests in Software Engineering is going through the process of making software. I think that is the most interesting part for me. Another interesting thing is collaboration. In Computer Engineering Classes, collaboration does not really happen all that often. Often times you are working on the code alone, but you can ask for your fellow peers for help, but that is about it. So, I am hoping to experience what it is like to collaborate together. Now I have used GitHub along with its Desktop application. I am more experienced with the Git Source Control than GitHub itself.

## What do I want to learn going forward?

The process of going from an idea to a product is something that I find intriguing. I want to learn more about the process of how things progress. I have projects that I have not finished yet (partly because AI Training has not been going well), and I would like some insight on how to keep project on track. Some companies even delay releasing products in order to have more time to work on it.
