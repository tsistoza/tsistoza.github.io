My experiences with JavaScript so far have been good. I have learned a bit about JavaScript during the summer. I have never really written JavaScript Code till now because at first glance I did not like the syntax (namely the keywords), and partly because I was enjoying writing C# Scripts at the time. The first programming languages I learned are C and C++, C# kind of resembles the C and C++, which is why I enjoyed learning C#. However, that does not mean I do not like JavaScript. At the time I first learned JavaScript, I wanted to make a cool interactive website, however that also required me to learn HTML and CSS. I did not have the time to even start this project, since I was more motivated to do the other projects that I had already started prior to coming into the summer break. As far as I think about JavaScript, I think it’s a great programming language, so far, I have gotten used to the syntax. If you are familiar with Python programming then the syntax is very different compared to what I have already learned in C and C++, however JavaScript syntax is somewhat similar in C.


New things I have learned from ES6, mainly with the code that I have written so far in JavaScript I have been using more of the let keyword, than the var keyword, because its only defined in the block you have it contained in, that just seems a lot better compared to a var keyword. As well as that, I have been using the ES6 way of writing a function. I do not know, but the code just looks a lot cleaner. Also, the rest parameter, is such an incredible addition to JavaScript, it makes the parameters of a function a lot cleaner, but also reduces the number of parameters being used which could be a good thing, I have been using C and C++, which is strict on what is being passed through functions, but also the ability to pass functions as parameters to other functions. Again, I have not found a case where I would probably use it, but it’s a nice welcome.
Now I would just like to note that I am a Computer Engineering major, which means most of the work we do is on the hardware side of things (i.e., C/C++ programming). As far as my perspective of JavaScript on Software Engineering I think it is good, it integrates well with HTML and CSS, and JavaScript is probably one of the programming languages that software engineers should know. Now on what I think of Athletic Software Engineering, I think it’s good for teaching students and familiarizing students with concepts that they have just learned. However, I think the caveats are that it does require you to put more hours into the class in comparison to other classes, but there is no denying that it is better for students, but at the same time students also have other classes, and maybe a job to attend to.


In conclusion, I had a lot of learning JavaScript again, this time around I am much more inclined to write JavaScript code. I am a lot more comfortable writing JavaScript code now compared to when I learned it, but I expect the assignments to be more difficult, the more we learn, so hopefully the WODs we are doing will help me in the long run. The “freecodecamp” website is the first time I have ever used it, but I do see myself using it again. Generally, when I want to learn something new, I would just watch a YouTube video.
