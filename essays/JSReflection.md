My experiences with JavaScript so far have been good. I have learned a bit about JavaScript during the summer. I have never really written JavaScript Code till now because at first glance I did not like the syntax (namely the keywords), and partly because I was enjoying writing C# Scripts at the time. The first programming languages I learned are C and C++, C# kind of resembles the C and C++, which is why I enjoyed learning C#. However, that does not mean I do not like JavaScript. At the time I first learned JavaScript, I wanted to make a cool interactive website, however that also required me to learn HTML and CSS. I did not have the time to even start this project, since I was more motivated to do the other projects that I had already started prior to coming into the summer break. As far as I think about JavaScript, I think it’s a great programming language, so far, I have gotten used to the syntax. If you are familiar with Python programming then the syntax is very different compared to what I have already learned in C and C++, however JavaScript syntax is somewhat similar in C.


New things I have learned from ES6, mainly with the code that I have written so far in JavaScript I have been using more of the let keyword, than the var keyword, because its only defined in the block you have it contained in, that just seems a lot better compared to a var keyword. As well as that, I have been using the ES6 way of writing a function. I do not know, but the code just looks a lot cleaner. Also, the rest parameter, is such an incredible addition to JavaScript, it makes the parameters of a function a lot cleaner, but also reduces the number of parameters being used which could be a good thing, I have been using C and C++, which is strict on what is being passed through functions, but also the ability to pass functions as parameters to other functions. Again, I have not found a case where I would probably use it, but it’s a nice welcome.
Now I would just like to note that I am a Computer Engineering major, which means most of the work we do is on the hardware side of things (i.e., C/C++ programming). As far as my perspective of JavaScript on Software Engineering I think it is good, it integrates well with HTML and CSS, and JavaScript is probably one of the more popular programming languages out there.
