## Introduction

I barely use any type of AI in this class. The only exceptions are using Bings ChatGPT (Copilot). I used to reduce the time I am trying to search for a specific thing. And I think using AI tools is great, just that when you are taking these classes you want these concepts to be stuck in your head, and I feel that using AI to write code defeats that purpose.

## Experience with AI

Workout of the Day (WOD) is a challenge that will help you remember concepts moving forward. I have not used at all on WODs, this includes Experience WODs, in-class Practice WODs, and in-class WODs, just because I find it more practical to actually drill these concepts into your brain, so whenever the in-class WODs take place, I am prepared for it. 

I did not use AI on Essays, as most of it is my experience with the concept. I have not used it with Final Project, because I just did not need it. Learning concepts, I used ChatGPT. An example of it is when I was first learning about underscore library. I did not understand how any of the functions worked. Let’s take each function as an example. I did not know how to use this function at all, used ChatGPT to help me familiarize myself with it. The functions were too confusing for me to understand, so I used ChatGPT to search for examples of using underscore functions to familiarize myself with it. 

I have not used AI to answer questions in class or discord, because if you must use AI to answer a question on discord, then that person should've just searched it online. Explaining code with AI, I do not think its practical because I want to understand the code, not tell an AI to explain the code for me. Similarly with writing code, I did not use AI because there is no need for me to, I want to learn these concepts and using AI will defeat that purpose. The same thing applies to documenting code, you should be able to document your own code without the use of AI because you wrote the code. Never really needed AI for Quality Assurance either, because ESLint is straightforward.

Now where I have used AI is finding resources. To put it more simply, I use Bing's ChatGPT (Copilot) to find resources to help assist me with any wall that I eventually run into. An example of where I used ChatGPT is trying to find out what a function does. I found a ton of functions, that I have no idea what it is doing, eventually ended up using ChatGPT. ChatGPT significantly reduces the amount of time I am searching for the resource I need.

## Learning and Comprehension with AI.

This is where I mostly use ChatGPT to help me find resources on a specific topic. The use of AI here significantly cuts down the time you need to find, understand, and learn a topic. It is almost crazy how much AI has been advancing to help us with our everyday lives. AI has helped me level up and improve my learning and understanding of software engineering concepts.

## Practical Applications

Outside of AI, Microsoft has been adding a couple AI features to Windows 11. I have been using Copilot, which is ChatGPT, to help me with writing informative essays in other classes. Copilot is built into Windows 11. Like I discussed above, it significantly reduces the amount of time spent on a specific topic. In this case, I use ChatGPT to summarize webpages for me. I also use Copilot when learning in class. I am a Computer Engineer. We take Electrical Engineering classes and they have proven to be extremely difficult, so I always have Copilot up and running when the professors are lecturing. For me AI has been extremely effective for me. The only problem I have with AI is that I wish I found this sooner.

## Challenges and Opportunities

I have not really found any challenges with the use of AI within the course, I have previously used AI prior to this course, so I have a good idea on where to use AI. I also have no idea where else you can further integrate AI into software engineering other than GitHub Copilot writing the code for you.

## Comparative Analysis

The difference is that traditionally you will search online or maybe even search for it on stack overflow. Let’s take quicksort algorithm as an example. Suppose you wanted to implement a quicksort algorithm traditionally you would search it online for what a quicksort algorithm is then implement it yourself. For AI-enhanced approaches we can just make ChatGPT figure out how to implement it, then we can just figure out how to implement it into our program.

## Future Considerations

The future role of AI will keep moving forward. As someone who is learning about Deep Learning, during this past year AI has just been blowing up lately. I expect AI to be used more extensively in the future by students. I do expect AI to advance, more specifically GitHub Copilot, but does require a lot of computation for that to happen.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I have not used AI in this class too much, but outside of this class, I have been using it very extensively. To be more specific, I use ChatGPT to level up my learning, comprehension, and reduce time on topics whether it is in Computer Science or Electrical Engineering. I am expecting AI to keep evolving as time goes on, as long as GPUs, and CPUs continue to improve.
