<p>Have you ever wondered why a question can never be a bad question? Well, the main reason we ask questions is to get a better understanding of what the topic is about, I think that is why most of us ask questions, even if you are introverted, you go online to search for answers about your questions. Here’s what this whole essay is about: improving your questions so that they are somewhat challenging, but also getting the person answering to actually think of an answer. Oftentimes, at least on the Internet, people just absolutely go out of their way to insult you and your questions, especially on Stack Overflow.</p>

<h2 id="making-smart-questions">Making “Smart Questions”</h2>

<p>How exactly do we format “Smart Questions”? What exactly is a smart question? Well, to put it simply, a smart question is a question where it helps you develop our understanding, and often reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about otherwise. Often when people ask questions online, they are often met with what looks to be hostility and arrogance, but it is not true, oftentimes they are hostile to people who seem to be unwilling to do their own homework before asking questions, it makes it seem like you are trying to cheat on homework.  Ask an actually good question, one that you cannot find online, through a friend, or someone who is skilled in that field, and when you have to resort to asking questions, display the fact that you have done your due diligence in the topic at hand, and show that you have been doing research. In other words, give the problem some thought before approaching experts, they will be able to tell from your questions how much research you have done, and would definitely be more willing to help you</p>

<h2 id="example-of-smart-question-and-bad-question">Example of “Smart Question” and Bad Question</h2>

<p>Now, I use Stack Overflow excessively, especially with C/C++ programming, as at least to me, it is one of the more difficult Programming Languages to learn because it’s a low-level programming language. And I came across numerous smart questions exploring Stack Overflow. I had a project where we had to recreate a bash shell equivalent in C, and I wanted to implement pipes. So I searched on Stack Overflow about implementing pipes, and eventually found one. Here is what the owner of the post did. The person clearly stated what he already knows about the topic at hand, then the person proceeds to show what the problem is on his code, and most importantly the programmer shows his code on the post. In particular, the person shows that research has been done, and is seeking help. I generally think it is a good idea to provide the code, so that volunteers can pinpoint what exactly is the problem. Here is the link to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33884291/pipes-dup2-and-exec">post.</a></p>

<p>Now let’s move on to an example of a bad question. A Stack Overflow user posted a question. The post has no context, nor does it show that the original poster has not been doing their research or even try to attempt to search it online. This post in particular has a lot of dislikes, and it tells me that the original owner of the post is lazy, and does not want to do any work at all. Here is the link to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3905734/how-to-send-100-000-emails-weekly">post</a>.</p>
