# Introduction to Design Patterns

I have never heard about Design Patterns before till now, but somehow, I have applied Design Patterns throughout my college career in programming. Design patterns are general, reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Design patterns are templates or guidelines for how to find a solution to a problem in different situations. Not all solutions are the same but are unique in their own way. However, what design patterns do is make your code flexible, reusable, and maintainable. Think of design patterns as a way for developers to communicate with each other more effectively. Let us take for example, Airbnb JavaScript style. Airbnb is a JavaScript style guide that we apply to our JavaScript code. For example, there should always be a new line at the end of a file. Airbnb allows for code to be more uniform throughout the code, this means others reading your code have an easy time reading it.

# Unconsciously using Design Patterns

There are three main types of design patterns, creation, structural, and behavioral. Creational deals with objects or classes. Structural deals with organizing and composing these classes or objects. Behavioral deals with how classes or objects interact and communicate with each other. I am sure most of us have already used design patterns before, whether you know or not. For me, I have used creational patterns, more specifically singleton. Singleton is a creational pattern that ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point to it. This does not apply to just JavaScript in general, but also in C++, Python, and C#. All of which are programming languages that I am very familiar with.

I also have used Structural patterns, in particular Observer. Observer is a behavioral pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, such that when one object changes, all its dependents are notified and updated. Let us take stop lights for example. Stop lights are dependent on other Stop lights at a cross-section. Suppose one of the Stop lights turns red, that means another stop light turns green in response to that stop light turning red. There are many more design patterns that I have noted here, but these are the ones that I use daily.
